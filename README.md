# Thermostat-Project
Project Reflection
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The thermostat project was designed to create a prototype for a smart thermostat, addressing the need for an embedded system that monitors and controls room temperature. The project integrates multiple hardware components—including a temperature sensor, LED indicators, buttons, an LCD, and UART communication—to simulate a complete system that adjusts its behavior based on the environment and user input. The primary problem it solves is to demonstrate low-level control of hardware via a state machine, and to simulate how such a system would report data to a central server.

2. What did you do particularly well?
I successfully designed and implemented a modular state machine that clearly separates the responsibilities of each component. The use of interrupt-driven button inputs and a multithreaded display update system ensures the system remains responsive. Additionally, the integration of various peripherals using industry-standard libraries and best practices in code formatting and commenting demonstrates a strong grasp of embedded systems design.

3. Where could you improve?
While the project meets all functional requirements, I recognize that further refinements could include enhanced error handling, more robust testing on edge cases (such as sensor failures), and improvements in the user interface on the LCD. Moreover, refining the integration with cloud services and optimizing the power consumption for production deployment are areas I could improve in future iterations.

4. What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Throughout this project, I enhanced my knowledge of several key tools and resources:
- Git and GitHub: For version control and collaborative project management.
- Python Libraries: Such as GPIOZero for hardware interfacing, smbus2 for I2C communication, and PySerial for UART.
- Online Documentation and Forums: Resources like the Raspberry Pi Foundation documentation, Stack Overflow, and embedded systems blogs.
- Diagramming Tools: Draw.io for creating state machine diagrams, which helps visualize system behavior.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills developed during this project are highly transferable:
- Embedded Systems Programming: Designing state machines and handling peripheral interfaces.
- Hardware Integration: Effectively managing communication with sensors, displays, and other components.
- Software Design: Applying modularity, clear documentation, and best coding practices.
- Problem-Solving: Adapting code to meet specific business requirements and hardware constraints. These skills will support future projects in both embedded systems development and broader software engineering tasks.
  
6. How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I prioritized maintainability by:
- Modular Code Structure: Each function (e.g., updating LEDs, processing button inputs, managing display output) is encapsulated in well-defined methods.
- Consistent Naming Conventions and Comments: The code is thoroughly commented, with clear variable and function names that make the logic easy to follow.
- State Machine Documentation: The accompanying state machine diagram clearly defines system behavior and transitions, making it easier to adapt the code to new requirements.
- Use of Industry Standards: Leveraging libraries like GPIOZero and PySerial ensures that the code adheres to widely accepted practices and can be easily updated or expanded as needed.
